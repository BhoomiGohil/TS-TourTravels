# Tour and Travels

You will need a copy of Node.js as an environment to run the package. Then you use a dependency manager like npm, yarn or pnpm to download TypeScript into your project.

npm install typescript --save-dev

Now, you have to create tsconfig.json file using following command:

npx tsc --init

You can then run the TypeScript compiler using one of the following commands:

npx tsc

Note: Link your compile file to HTML file/files and also don't forgot to run your project using live server extension if you are using Visual Studio.

Step:

1. Navigate to Extensions.
2. Search for "Live Server" and install it.
3. Click on Go Live option to run project.

Note: You have to run npx tsc command for compiling the file after update.

Happy coding.
